# dreamer-for-text
This repository attempts to combine the [Dreamer reinforcement learning algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01603) with a language modeling objective to determine if encoded world models can significantly improve text coherency, accuracy, and most importantly, soul.

No guarantees it'll work. But screw it, we ball.

## Installation
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## TODO:
- [ ] Adapt Dreamer-v1 model to text generation
- [ ] Set up configs
- [ ] Implement trainer
- [ ] Implement tokenizing
- [ ] Add huggingface `datasets` support
- [ ] Implement DreamerV2 algorithm
- [ ] Implement DreamerV3 algorithm
- [ ] And more...
