# dreamer-for-text
This repository attempts to combine the [DreamerV3 reinforcement learning algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04104) with a language modeling objective to determine if encoded world models can significantly improve text coherency, accuracy, and most importantly, soul.

No guarantees it'll work. But screw it, we ball.

## Installation
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## TODO:
- [] Adapt Dreamer model to text generation
- [] Set up configs
- [] Implement trainer
- [] Implement tokenizing
- [] Add huggingface `datasets` support
- [] And more...
